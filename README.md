## Intro

I'm a software engineer who loves crafting elegant, resilient and creative solutions to the most interesting and challenging problems. I have experience site-building with HTML and CMSs like Drupal and Wordpress, but I really thrive when I get to architect front end code that will stand the test of time, and make future-me proud of the code I wrote because of its ease of maintainability and ability to make an update without fearing that I'll break something somewhere else.

## Experience

**Frontend Engineer, Four Kitchens â€” 2016-Present**

- Performed the roles of **Frontend Architect**, **Design System Implementor**, **Engineer**, and **Frontend Consultant** on projects for clients such as Yale, Ithaca College, NYU, New York Public Library, and others.
- Led teams of jr and full-stack engineers to develop **resilient** and **maintainable frontend architecture** to be deployed to dozens of sites so that updates and tweaks could be pushed out with ease while maintaining a stable code base.
- Identified and resolved **performance** and **accessibility** issues on existing code bases to improve visitor retention, search engine optimization, and usability for all site visitors.
- Worked closely with internal and external designers to **translate** their static **designs** to **fully responsive, accessible, and user-friendly** web applications that often exceeded the designers original vision.
- Implemented **design systems** for large organizations with numerous web properties in a way that enables them to share common code across properties, while maintaining the flexibility to deviate on a per-property basis when necessary. This has made their organizations **code quality** and **maintainability exponentially better**.
- Implemented **visual regression testing** to ensure the integrity of design patterns when developing new features, fixing backend/code-related bugs, and refactoring code for performance and scalability.
- Organized and led the Four Kitchens Frontend Practice Group - an internal, bi-weekly meetup focused on **frontend education**, **best practices**, and **professional development**.
- **Co-led** the creation of **Emulsify**, an open-source tool for creating **design systems with reusable components, and clear guidelines** for teams.
- Utilized tools such as Git, StyleLint, ESLint, Prettier, and CircleCI to ensure **code quality**, correctness, and **maintainability**.
